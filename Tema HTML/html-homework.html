                        <h3>Rules for Autocomplete</h3>
                        <small><i>Posted on March 19, 2019</i></small>
                        <p>
                            Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but so so so 
                            many UIs get it wrong. I see this frequently enough that, rather than complain about them
                            individually, I thought I'd just write down the set of rules they often break.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing to do, but there 
                            should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these rules 
                            don't apply if a field must be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list ofUS states).
                            Following these rules should always result in at very least a same experience:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly,
                                    other options must always go below the one matching what they typed.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first, If I type "Fr" I want "Fresno"
                                    not "San Francisco".
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with substring
                                    matches would almost always be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words
                                    at the beginning not somwhere in the middle.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    if there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequence matching.
                                    This is only useful in some cases.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to 
                                    approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to provide.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Matches should be sorted alphabetically
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When one option is the prefix of another, put the <i>shortest one first.</i>
                                </li>
                                <li>The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two options
                                    that differ only by case. In that case (put intended), prefer the one that more 
                                    closely matches the user's input.
                                </li>
                                <li>The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term)must be a different key
                                    than the action to accept the first suggestion <i>unless</i> you have to do something 
                                    first to start using autocomplete suggestion (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should
                                    never have to take extra steps to <i>not</i> use autocomplete.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                                appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, 
                                                developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling). Possessing a great sense

                                                in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent. It is a popular 
                                                pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems. </p>
